## CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning - A Comprehensive Summary

This README provides a concise yet detailed overview of the key takeaways from each week of the CS224N course. It's designed as a quick reference guide for essential NLP concepts, equations, and models covered.

**Week 1: Word Embeddings**

* **Word Vectors:** Representing words as dense vectors capturing semantic relationships.
    * **Word2Vec:** Learning word embeddings using a shallow neural network to predict context words (CBOW) or target words (Skip-gram).
        * **Objective Function (Skip-gram):** Maximize the probability of observing context words given the target word.
    * **GloVe (Global Vectors):** Combines global co-occurrence statistics with local context window information for robust embeddings.
* **Word Window Classification:** Using word embeddings for tasks like Named Entity Recognition by classifying words within a fixed window.
* **Key Equations:** 
    * **Softmax:**  p(o|c) = exp(u_o^T v_c) / sum(exp(u_w^T v_c))
    * **Cross-Entropy Loss:** J = - sum(y_i * log(p_i))
* **Evaluation:** Intrinsic (e.g., word similarity) and extrinsic (e.g., downstream task performance) evaluation methods for embeddings.

**Week 2: Neural Networks and Dependency Parsing**

* **Backpropagation:** The core algorithm for training neural networks by calculating gradients and updating weights.
* **Neural Networks:** Architectures for learning complex patterns from data.
* **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzing grammatical structure by identifying head-dependent relationships between words in a sentence.
    * **Transition-based Parsing:** Uses a stack and a buffer to predict dependency relations sequentially.
* **Key Concepts:** Gradient Descent, Chain Rule, Activation Functions (Sigmoid, ReLU), Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

**Week 3: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Language Models**

* **RNNs:** Networks designed to process sequential data like text by maintaining hidden states that capture information from previous time steps.
* **Language Models:** Predicting the probability of a sequence of words, used for tasks like text generation and machine translation.
* **Vanishing Gradients:** Difficulty in training RNNs due to gradients vanishing or exploding over long sequences.
* **Key Architectures:** 
    * **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Addresses vanishing gradients with a gating mechanism.
    * **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit):** Simplified LSTM with fewer parameters.
* **Key Equations:** 
    * **RNN Hidden State Update:** h_t = tanh(W_hh * h_{t-1} + W_xh * x_t + b_h)

**Week 4: Machine Translation and Attention**

* **Machine Translation:** Using neural networks to translate text between languages.
* **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:** Encoder-decoder architecture for mapping input sequences to output sequences.
* **Attention Mechanism:** Allows the decoder to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating the output.
    * Improves performance by handling long-range dependencies.
* **Subword Models:** Handling out-of-vocabulary words by representing words as subword units (e.g., BPE, WordPiece).

**Week 5: Transformers and Pretraining**

* **Transformers:** Architecture based on self-attention mechanisms, replacing recurrent networks for sequence modeling.
    * **Self-Attention:** Allows a word to attend to all other words in the sequence, capturing long-range dependencies effectively.
* **Pretraining:** Training large language models on massive text data (e.g., BERT, GPT) and fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks.
* **Key Concepts:** Multi-Head Attention, Positional Encoding, Layer Normalization

**Week 6: Question Answering and Natural Language Generation**

* **Question Answering (QA):** Building systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
    * **Extractive QA:** Identifying the answer span within a given context passage.
    * **Open-domain QA:** Retrieving relevant information from a large knowledge base to answer questions.
* **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Generating coherent and grammatically correct text from structured data or other inputs.
* **Key Models:** 
    * **BiDAF (Bidirectional Attention Flow):** Popular model for extractive QA.
    * **Pointer Networks:** Used for tasks like summarization and text simplification.

**Week 7: Coreference Resolution and Large Language Models**

* **Coreference Resolution:** Identifying and clustering mentions in text that refer to the same entity.
* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations of LLMs like GPT-3 and their impact on NLP research.
* **Key Concepts:** Anaphora Resolution, Mention Detection, Clustering Algorithms

**Week 8-11: Advanced Topics and Applications**

* **Knowledge Integration:** Incorporating external knowledge sources (e.g., knowledge graphs) into language models.
* **Model Analysis and Explanation:** Understanding the inner workings of NLP models and making their predictions more interpretable.
* **Social and Ethical Considerations:** Bias in NLP models, fairness, and responsible AI development.
* **Future of NLP:** Emerging trends and research directions in the field.
